# Subaru-4EAT-Sequential-Shifter
Plans to create a stand alone sequential shifter for the Subaru phase 2 4EAT transmission via an esp-12e microcontroller.

The idea is to use as much existing hardware as possible. 

Keep the stock shifter using the inhibitor switch "D" Will be used as 4th gear.

Cables would come from transmission to unit then any extra sensors passed to the stock TCM/ECU.

The option for units active or passive mode would be an eventual goal.
